My recording software was set to a small size of 640x360. I can certainly record in much larger sizes, but I trust this will be adequate. The small 32mb size means it should be easy to work with.

I didn't realize that all the content I had created was just over 7 minutes. Now that I have done this, I can certainly find ways to shrink the time and make it more focused. I figure you have people to help me with that.
