# Introduction to Java 
This interactive Introduction to Java course, based on Java LTS, is tailored specifically for beginners with no previous programming experience, targeting those pursuing software or data engineering careers. This course introduces fundamental concepts, ranging from writing code comments and executing arithmetic operations to exploring Java's primitive and non-primitive data types. Learners will learn to manage information by declaring variables and employing a variety of data structures. They will understand comparison operators and use them interactively to execute code based on certain conditions. The course concludes with an exploration of for and while loops as well as switch statements.

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Java
Reviews the origins of Java, differences from other languages, setting up their environment, and creating their first program. 

1. What is Java?
   1. The benefits and uses of Java
   2. Java is a platform
   3. Platform agnostic
   4. Who, what, when, where, why? (maybe)
   5. Anatomy of a Java program
   6. Where did Java come from?
   7. Differences from other programming and scripting language
   8. A history of Java
   9. Where is Java used?
   10. Platform independence: features of java
       1. Simple, Object-Oriented, Portable, Platform independent, Secured, Robust, Architecture neutral, Interpreted, High Performance, Multithreaded, Distributed, Dynamic
   11. The TLA's. The JVM (Java Virtual Machine), JDK, and JRE
   12. Not a scripting language. Pros & Cons
   13. Anatomy of a .java file
   14. Classes - Have to start somewhere
   15. Methods - Where the code lives in a class
   16. Every file is a class, sometimes more than one
   17. We will be using a simple text editor and command line for this course.
   18. Where to begin: main()
   19. Writing your first program - Hello World!
       1. java output : System.out.println("Hello World!");
   20. Setting up your development environment
   21. Compiling your program
   22. Running your program
   23. how is a java program run?
       1. Class file, Classloader, Bytecode Verifier, Interpreter, Runtime, Hardware

## Chapter 2: Fundamental concepts: Operators and data types
   1. writing code comments: 3 types: single line, multiline, and documentation comments
   2. assignment operator: =
   3. arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %, also these followed by =
   4. operator precedence
   5. unary operators: +, -, ++, --, !
   6. equality & conditional operators: ==, !=, >, >= , <, <=
   7. conditional operators: &&, ||, ternary (?:)
   8. type comparison: instanceof
   9. bitwise operators: ~, &, |, ^, <<, >>, >>>
   10. strongly typed language
   11. primitive data types
   12. non-primitive data types: array, class, interface, String, Enum
       1. arrays
          1. initializing arrays
          2. changing array values
          3. array length
          4. initial value of array values
          5. multi-dimensional arrays
       2. class 
       3. interface
       4. String
       5. Enum
   13. declaring variables
   14. how variables are named: camel case, snake case, _prefix, etc.
   15. introducing nothing: null
   16. the importance of naming: keywords, reserved, documentation
   17. primitive arrays and introducing _new_
   18. employing a variety of data structures
   19. converting types: type casting
       1. automatic: widening (byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double)
       2. manual: narrowing (double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte)

## Chapter 3: Conditions and comparisons
   1. expressions and statements
   2. What is a condition?
   3. What is a statement?
   4. assignment, ++ or --
   5. What is an expression?
   6. compound expressions: ambiguous and unambiguous
   7. if statement
   8. if..else statement
   9. Conditional branching
   10. Too many conditions, introducing the switch statement
   11. Fancy switch statements
   12. Constructing workflows based on conditions
   13. code blocks: {} syntax, intro to

## Chapter 5: Loops - Repetitive processing
   1. for statement
   2. structure of a for loop: 3 statements
   3. for each loop
   4. looping through an array
   5. while statement
   6. do..while statement
   7. Loops inside loops
   8. Getting out of a loop early
   9. Avoiding infinite loops
   10. Evaluating how long loops will run
