# Introduction to Java 
This interactive Introduction to Java course, based on Java LTS, is tailored specifically for beginners with no previous programming experience, targeting those pursuing software or data engineering careers. This course introduces fundamental concepts, ranging from writing code comments and executing arithmetic operations to exploring Java's primitive and non-primitive data types. Learners will learn to manage information by declaring variables and employing a variety of data structures. They will understand comparison operators and use them interactively to execute code based on certain conditions. The course concludes with an exploration of for and while loops as well as switch statements.

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Java
Java is everywhere and many things are created with it. Learn why so many choose it. No prior knowledge is required.

### Lesson 1.1: History, Differences, Why Java?

* Learner will be able to explain the Java platform and how it runs their code
* Learner will be able to discover other Java versions and their features

### Lesson 1.3: Writing and Running Java
* Learner will be able to prepare their Java development environment
* Learner will be able to create their first Java program
* Learner will be able to explain how a Java program is run

## Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts
The basic building blocks of the language and how they fit together.

### Lesson 2.1: Data Types - Primitive
* The learner will be able to list the basic data types and their value limits 
* The learner will be able to write values using different types of notation
* The learner will be able to convert values between different data types

### Lesson 2.2: Variables
* The learner will be able to create variables and assign values and expressions to them
* The learner will be able to demonstrate how variables are used
* The learner will be able to decide on useful variable names
* The learner will be able to convert variables from one type to another

### Lesson 2.3: Operators
* The learner will be able to identify the different types of operators available
* The learner will be able to compare two different values

* The learner will be able to evaluate the order of operations in an expression

### Lesson 2.4: Data Types - Non-Primitive
* The learner will be able to create variables that can hold many values
* The learner will be able to develop custom data structures
* The learner will be able to describe how Strings are created and how they work

## Chapter 3: Control and Flow
Comparing values and making decisions.

### Lesson 3.1: From Expressions to Statements
* Learner will be able to create statements using comparisons and expressions
* Learner will be able to distinguish between different types of statements
* Learner will be able to appraise whether an expression is ambiguous or not 

### Lesson 3.2: Blocks and Scope
* Learner will be able to construct a block of statements
* Learner will be able to explain what variable scope is
* Learner will be able to identify the scope of a variable within nested blocks

### Lesson 3.3: Conditional Statements
* Learner will be able to construct a conditional statement
* Learner will be able to decide on the type of flow that should be used
* Learner will be able to assess when there are too many conditional statements
* Learner will be able to rearrange a set of comparisons to simplify how they are evaluated

### Lesson 3.4: Comments
* Learner will be able to create the 3 types of comments that are available
* Learner will be able to decide on which type of comment should be used
* Learner will be able to assess whether a comment is needed or not
* Learner will be able to describe how documentation is created from doc comments

## Chapter 4: Loops
Doing the same thing to a lot of values.
### Lesson 4.1: `for` loop
* Learner will be able to construct the 3-statement version of a `for` loop
* Learner will be able to construct the `for..each` loop
* Learner will be able to create the statements needed for both styles of `for` loops

### Lesson 4.2: `while` and `do...while` loops
* Learner will be able to construct either a `while` or `do..while` loop construct
* Learner will be able to evaluate whether their loop will run forever
* Learner will be able to organize loops inside of other loops

### Lesson 4.4: Jump statements: `break` and `continue`
* Learner will be able to construct a jump statement in a loop
* Learner will be able to evaluate when to use a jump statement
* Learner will be able to decide between the `break` and `continue` jump statements
* Learner will be able to evaluate how long a loop will run
